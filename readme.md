# My site

<a href="https://github.com/ItaloPussi/MeuSitePessoal/blob/master/readme.pt.md">VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs</a> ðŸ‘ˆ

One very important thing for programmers is to have a place where they can display their portfolio. In this project I will build my future website, which will be responsible for presenting my brand to the world. Built in two languages (Portuguese and English), it will show a little of my history in addition to my main projects.
